## What in Funkin?!

A lua mod made by [BombasticTom](https://www.youtube.com/@BombasticTom492) that implements a third strumline into the game.

## How in Funkin!?

This mod uses capibilities of [Psych Engine](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine) in order to work, such as [Lua](https://www.lua.org) and [HScript](https://lib.haxe.org/p/hscript) softcoding.

## Why in Funkin??!

After realizing how Psych Engine uses Lua, I wanted to push its boundaries to the fullest (by making the 3rd strumline, **back when there was no HScript ðŸ¥´**)

## How to Funkin?!??

As I know most people who downloaded this script don't know a lot about coding, I thought making documentation would make it easier for some people to understand how everything works.

### STUFF REQUIRED FOR FUNKIN?!?

Even though I said that this documentation is also for people who "don't know a lot about coding", **you should at least know some things right before jumping in**:

- [Basic Lua knowledge](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/lua/index.htm)
- [Basic understanding of Lua in Psych Engine](https://github.com/CaptainBaldi/PsychRewrittenWiki/wiki) - a wiki made by CaptainBaldi and multiple contributors, which expands the knowledge from the [official wiki](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine/wiki) (which is as of now outdated)

## Where do I start Funkin????

TBD.
